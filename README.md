# Keyboard Acoustic Emanations

This project is a Matlab implementation of Asonov and Agrawal's research on Keyboard Acoustic Emanations.

* For the theory read the paper in `doc/`

* For a practical introduction to the code check out this video: [A new generation of keyloggers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7SIAMjgoJ8)

## Tech bits

The core functions are located in `/lib` while in `/extra` I placed all the utilities that I used to understand what was not yielding the right results and why.
